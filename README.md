ECEAC1_Lab Activity 5: A function made of an if-elif-else structure that categorizes different age value inputs using Python.

This program was created using Pydroid 3. To make this, the code employed elements such as functions and if-else statments. It also used print functions to display specific messages and inputs to get information from the user. With these elements combined, it produced a final output.
